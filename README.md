# Oasis Metadata Registry

This repository contains an off-chain registry of signed statements about
various entities that may exist on the Oasis Network. Each statement is
self-certifying and should be independently verified before being used.

For tooling that can be used to verify and access the signed statements
programatically see the [metadata-registry-tools] repository.
